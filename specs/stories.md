## Context
[“The Week”](https://theweek-prototype.weebly.com/) is a 3 episodes documentary over the environmental and climate crisis.
It is created in such a way that people watching it go through several necessary psychological steps, so that in the end of the 3rd episode, they are ready for action.

We believe “The Week” can ignite the Web3 community around the challenges of the environmental and climate issues. As usual, coordination is the key, and that where our tool shows up.
## Actors
-  **Facilitators** volunteer to accompany watch parties. They make the collective experience optimal by ensuring sharings and conversations are going in the right direction
- **Participants** are people willing to go through the experience of watching "The week" with people they know. In our case, they are more specifically Web3 communities members: DAO's
- The first participant of a watch party is labelled the **organizer**: she will give a name to the watch party, and be the first to share the watch party's link to the other participants
- The **"The Week" DAO** is a collective entity for all the holders of "THEWEEK" token. At this time, it is not further defined
